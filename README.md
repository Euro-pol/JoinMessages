## About
Like everything says, it's a plugin that provides your server with better join messages. You can see the todo list lower.
Don't except this plugin to have perfect code, I'm making this to learn Java :)
I don't know if it supports new versions, since I only focused on 1.8.8.
Stay tuned for updates!

## Building
To build this plugin, [install maven on your system](https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi), go to the cloned folder and simply run 
`mvn install`

Now the built plugin should be in the target folder! ðŸ˜ƒ

##  Todo List
